Release Notes
==============

v1.6.2
===========================
Version 1.6.1 is a maintenance release and only contains bug fixes.

This release resolves an issue when writing to floating point wave files.
Certain values were not writable by the float writing code. This would cause
debug build to assert while release builds would write incorrect output.

History
~~~~~~~

v1.6.1
===========================
Version 1.6.1 is a maintenance release and only contains bug fixes.

JIRA ISSUES RESOLVED
===========================
FILEIO-46 Warning "#1035-D: single-precision operand implicitly converted to
          double-precision" in dlb_wave_float.c
FILEIO-47 dlb_riff_read_next_chunk() fails on odd-size data chunk

v1.6.0
===========================
The release includes the following changes:
- Nearest-even rounding for all conversions where the bit-depth is reduced.
- Removed all existing unit tests which relied on external file IO and
  replaced them with more comprehensive tests.
- Removed the dlb_wave_transcode and dlb_wave_generate projects.
- Removed all wave files that were included in releases.
- Made floating point packing and unpacking code more consistent.
- Reading and writing waves now correctly respects 2-octet chunk alignment as
  per RIFF specification. (FILEIO-15)
- Unit tests have been executed on ARM (Pandaboard), Ubuntu x86/amd64 and
  Windows VS2010 x86/amd64 - all tests pass.

JIRA ISSUES RESOLVED
===========================
FILEIO-8  Signed integer overfloat at compile time in dlb_wave_float.c
FILEIO-12 Reduce the size of the test vectors
FILEIO-15 dlb_riff doesn't handle chunk alignment correctly
FILEIO-20 Add dlb_wave float file testing
FILEIO-24 dlb_riff_seek_chunk() trashes chunk location
FILEIO-27 Problems with DLB_BUFFER_LONG_32 on Linux 64 and Mac
FILEIO-29 dlb_wave manifest files have dependency on intrinsics backends
FILEIO-36 dlb_wave does not seem to handle denormal floats correctly.
FILEIO-37 There are a few warnings in dlb_wave after removing all suppressed
          warning numbers in msvs project file
FILEIO-39 Address Visual Studio warnings given the new mbuild default warning
          level.
FILEIO-43 Buffer conversion to the output bit depth does not apply rounding.
FILEIO-45 some of the 8 bit wave file conversions are broken

KNOWN ISSUES
===========================
FILEIO-3/FILEIO-5/FILEIO-13 Documentation/Doxygen related enhancements

v1.5.2
===========================
The release includes the following changes:
- Fixing precision of 16-bit wavefile writing (replaced truncation by rounding)
- Remove some compiler warnings

v1.5.1
===========================
The release includes the following changes:
- Workaround for fseek bug in windows libc
- Avoid undefined behaviour (left shift of signed), which causes runtime traps when built in debug mode with clang.
- Fixing a bug in reading float wave files in to left aligned dlb_buffer
- Adding math library dependency in manifest files for dlb_wave_float_ojbects (required by lrintf)
- Fixing compilation of transcode and generate projects

v1.5
===========================
The release include the following changes:
- Fixing bug FILEIO-24
- Fixing channel_mask in API to be unsigned long
- Removing couple of warning in dlb_wave_int.c and dlb_wave_float.d that would show up in ICC compilers
- Fixing a bug in handling error chunks

v1.4.1
===========================
- Removed unlicensed wave files from release.

v1.4
===========================
- New API for reporting dlb_version
- Added Rounding (instead of truncation) when reading float wave files
- resolved couple of warnings
- update dlb_buffer to v1.2

v1.3
===========================
- new seek api: dlb_wave_seek_frame
- dlb_wave memory mapped files
- fix bug related to dlb_wave float read

v1.2
===========================
- Support for mbuild 1.2
- Support for munit 1.2
- New API for returning number of frames in a file (a frame is single time sample from all channels)
- Fixed some windows warnings (still some linux warnings remaining).
- Fix linux warnings (v1.2.1)
- Fixed test harness compilation for linux

Known Issues
============
No testing was done for dlb_wave float files

Testing
=======
Tested by dlb_wave munit tests.
